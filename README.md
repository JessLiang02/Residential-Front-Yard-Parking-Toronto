# Toronto Residential Front Yard Parking Analysis

## Overview

This repository focuses on analyzing Toronto's Residential Front Yard Parking dataset to explore patterns and factors influencing parking permissions and availability.

-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models and an API of the model. 
-   `other` contains sketches and literature.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, test, visualize, and build models on the data.
